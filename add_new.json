      "detail_info_2": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Thrills and spills in Sin City</h3><p>In Gangstar Vegas you star as a <strong>prize fighter</strong> who upsets a mob boss and must run for his life, before seeking to get his own back. It's an age-old tale and there's little originality in the way the story played out in Gangstar Vegas. <strong>The main character's personality</strong> feels a bit wooden and the script is pretty clichéd (some of the characters that appear are good fun, though). However, that doesn't mean that Gangstar Vegas isn't fun to play - quite the opposite, in fact.</p><div id=\"review-app-page-desktop-wrapper\" class=\"sam-slot mv-m sam-slot--in-read-video\" data-meta=\"sam-in-read-video\"><a id=\"review-app-page-desktop__close\" class=\"is-hidden\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"this.parentNode.style.display = 'none'; return false\"><div class=\"s-icon s-icon-close\"><svg class=\"s-icon__svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 1024 1024\" role=\"img\"><use class=\"s-icon__use\" xlink:href=\"#s-icon-symbol-close\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use></svg></div></a><div class=\"sam-slot__wrapper\"><div id=\"review-app-page-desktop\" class=\"sam-slot__content\"></div></div><script>sam.cmd.push(function() { sam.display('review-app-page-desktop'); });</script></div><p>The game world in Gangstar Vegas is immense - incredibly it's nine times bigger than the previous game, Gangstar Rio. There are <strong>80 different missions</strong> to complete in total, and they vary considerably in terms of gameplay, from prize fights to chasing bad guys on foot, to participating in street races. There are <strong>many challenges</strong> in Gangstar Vegas in which you can compete against others in online leaderboards.</p><p>The <em>Quick Play</em> mode in Gangstar Vegas allows you to part in one-off challenges, such as heists, brawls, <strong>survival</strong> and time attacks. It's great to be able to dive straight in and play in this way, especially if you've been away from the game for a long time and want to brush up on your skills before heading back into the main story.</p><p>The setting of Vegas makes for lots of fun, whether it's chasing bad guys down the strip at high speeds, or <strong>playing blackjacks</strong> in the casinos to earn more cash. As you play, you'll realize just how much there is to explore in Gangstar Vegas and the level of detail in the game world is impressive.</p><p>There are plenty of <strong>weapons to collect</strong> and upgrade in Gangstar Vegas, including guns, grenades, molotovs, flamethrowers, and baseball bats. The shop also allows you to change your look with new clothes, hair cuts, or even a chipmunk mask! Of course, you can buy <strong>vehicles</strong> as well, and the selection is very varied, covering everything from mopeds and trials bikes to monster trucks and tanks.</p></div>",
      "detailinfo_1": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h2 class=\"editor-review__headline\">Mindless violence comes to Las Vegas</h2><p>Gangstar Vegas is a <strong>thrill-a-minute action game</strong> set on the mean streets of Sin City. It's the fourth in Gameloft's series of GTA-style open world games and the biggest of the lot so far.</p></div>",
      "detailinfo_3": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Taking to the streets</h3><p><strong>The controls</strong> in Gangstar Vegas are much the same as previous versions of the game. You walk around using an on-screen directional pad and there are action buttons for running, shooting, and interacting with objects.</p><p>The <strong>driving controls</strong> can be set up according to what you find easier, allowing you to choose between tilt, arrows or stick-based steering. What's great is that you can define different control systems for cars and bikes, so you could use arrow-based steering for cars and tilt-based for motorcycles if you like.</p><p>There's the <strong>ubiquitous city map</strong>, which shows you where missions are and displays various points of interest. Generally you can skip straight to a mission in Gangstar Vegas without having to drive to the start point, which is handy. A mini map in the corner of the screen shows your current position.</p><p><strong>The graphics</strong> in Gangstar Vegas are very good, and rival those of the mobile versions of GTA III or Vice City. The city of Las Vegas is brought to life with an incredible level of detail and it really drags you into the story.</p><p><strong>Animation</strong> is great too and the accurate ragdoll effects make performing stunts a real treat. There are the occasional <strong>graphical glitches</strong> as with most huge games like this, but not enough to detract from the overall experience. The characters look good, although the voice acting is poor in places.</p><p>Be warned that bad language and adult themes litter the dialog, so Gangstar Vegas is certainly <strong>not suitable for children</strong>, and is classified accordingly. Just like GTA, Gangstar Vegas features in-car radio, and the range of stations seems very heavily influenced by the Rockstar game series. There's some quality tunes licensed though, with something to suit everyone.</p></div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>The verdict</h3><p>Gangstar Vegas borrows so much from <strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> that you'll forget it's a totally different game series. Of course, this is no bad thing and Gangstar Vegas is so big and deep that you'll struggle to find a better sandbox action for mobile - GTA included.</p></div>",

It’s especially useful if you want to <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/android/food-drink\" target=\"_blank\">discover eateries</a>, shopping malls, gas stations, and more in your area. This app is great if you need <strong>directions</strong> to a specific place.</p></div>",
      "detailinfo_3": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Choosing the best route</h3> <p>It’s easy to follow <strong>Google Maps’ directions</strong>, especially when you get to pick your favorite <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/downloads/route-planner?ex=CORE-1224.2\" target=\"_blank\">route</a>. It has a few options you can select with different priorities. If you’re low on gas, it can single out the best option for saving gas. If you’re running a bit late, you can ask for the <strong>fastest route available</strong> or minimize the number of stop signs and traffic lights on the way.</p> <p>If you’re on foot or need to take a bus, you can alternate between them to more accurately calculate your estimated time of arrival. When you <strong>swap</strong> between these, the interface changes accordingly. In fact, if you’re walking it’ll buzz twice when you need to turn and once after every block; there’s no need to hold your phone out as you roam the streets.</p> <p>The <strong>Maps public transport</strong> feature is also fantastic. You can see the times for each stop. If you input a destination that requires more than one bus, it’ll tell you how many you need to take and where each bus stop is. If any vehicle is running late, a nifty notification will pop up.</p> </div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>A smooth interface</h3> <p>It’s easy to move around Maps’ different menu systems and options. You can access tons of settings and tweaks with a slide of your finger to the right. Otherwise, a majority of the screen is a <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/downloads/maps?ex=CORE-1224.2\" target=\"_blank\">map</a> of the area you’re interested in. You can swap between <strong>satellite and roads</strong> for a different visual feel; this comes down to personal preference, though.</p> <p>The app responds to the day and night cycle. It switches to a <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/downloads/dark-theme?ex=CORE-1224.2\" target=\"_blank\">dark theme</a> or white to reflect the local time. While you can’t customize your icon on the <strong>map</strong>, you can modify different areas near you. For example, if you love a specific bakery, you can mark it with a tag of varied colors.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://google-earth.en.softonic.com/android\" target=\"_blank\">Google Earth</a></strong> has a very similar approach to the general interface. In both apps, you can drop down to surface level with the and <strong>explore different areas</strong> in 360 degrees. <strong>Maps’ Street view</strong> has images that are high quality and make it easy to find a specific store you’re trying to find. Google Earth lacks the navigation options, though.</p> </div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Reviews by you</h3> <p>Maps has a huge database of information to draw from. Millions of stores, restaurants, shopping malls, hospitals, and more, flood the app whenever you use it. If you’re interested in general thoughts on a specific location, you can look it up and see what people have to say. What’s more, you can leave your own opinion for the world to hear.</p> <p>This feedback system is generated by the user base and has no censorship other than for profanity and hate speech. For this reason, Maps is the best option when you need honest opinions on different places and services.</p> <p>The app also has a <strong>point system</strong>. When you jot down notes on an experience you have, you get a few points. You accumulate these with picture uploads and whenever you answer specific questions. Overall, the <strong>Google review</strong> feature is easy to use and useful for finding sincere feedback.</p> </div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Categories to explore</h3> <p>Maps has a list of topics you can sift through. Each of these is a group of similar services or locations that you might need. These include coffee, restaurants, groceries, attractions, gas stations, and more.</p> <p>The <strong>category feature</strong> is even more useful if you’re travelling. If you need something on the spot, you can open the app and quickly tap your way to what you’re looking for.</p></div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>A must-have app for travel</h3><p>All in all, Google Maps has everything you need for moving around the city or heading off on a long road trip. It’s easy to use, fast, has a clean interface and works like a charm. Watch out for battery usage, however, because this application drains power quite quickly. With this app in your pocket, you can go anywhere.</p> <p>In the latest patch you can share your location. You can set this to last for 24 hours or until you turn it off. You can also let other drivers and travellers know if there are speed cameras, police, or roadblocks in the city. They’ve also added a tracking system so you can see how many hours you walk or drive every day.

With one download you get a new everyday browser that offers seamless protections from most third-party trackers while you search and browse, and access to tracking protection when receiving email and using other apps on your device. With DuckDuckGo, privacy can be your default.<br><br><b>Search Privately</b> — DuckDuckGo Private Search comes built-in so you can search the web without being tracked. <br><br><b>Block Tracking Cookies</b> — prevent most 3rd-party cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.<br><br><b>Escape Website Trackers Before They Load</b> —We automatically stop most hidden trackers (3rd-party scripts) from loading, which prevents companies from collecting and using any personal data from these trackers.  Our cutting-edge tracker blocking technology – called 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection – goes above and beyond what you get in most popular browsers by default. <br><br><b>Automatically Enforce Encryption</b> — Smarter Encryption forces many sites you visit in DuckDuckGo to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes. <br><br><b>Block Email Trackers (Beta)</b> — 70% of emails track you as soon as you open them. Enabling Email Protection is the easy way to block most email trackers and hide your address without switching services. <br><br><b>Protect Your Privacy in Other Apps (Beta)</b> — Block most hidden app trackers in other apps day or night and prevent third-party companies from invading your privacy with App Tracking Protection.

Join the private waitlist for the free beta version through the app settings menu.<br><br>The DuckDuckGo app has the browsing features you expect, like tabs and bookmarks, plus privacy controls you’ll love. Taking control of your privacy doesn't have to mean making tradeoffs. <br><br><b>Tap Fire Button, Burn Data</b> — Clear your tabs and browsing data with one tap of the Fire Button. <br><br><b>Signal Your Privacy Preference with GPC</b> — Built into the app, Global Privacy Control (GPC) intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information.

Currently, if an advertiser wants to detect conversions on their own website for our private DuckDuckGo search ads, our 3rd-Party Tracker Loading Protection will not stop bat.bing.com requests from loading on the advertiser’s website following DuckDuckGo ad clicks, but those requests are stopped in all other contexts. This is because DuckDuckGo private search advertising is in partnership with Microsoft. As part of that partnership, viewing ads on DuckDuckGo is anonymous and Microsoft has committed to not profile our users’ ad clicks.  <br><br>Read more about this and our Tracking Protections at https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/privacy/web-tracking-protections/ <br><br>You don't need to wait to take back your privacy.

This is quite useful for anyone not wanting to be tracked. Whether you’re a regular person trying to avoid unnecessary advertisements or an activist hoping to bypass government restrictions, Tor Browser will be an excellent choice.</p><p>While other web browsers like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://chrome.en.softonic.com/android\"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://opera.en.softonic.com/android\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> provide incognito modes to delete records of websites visited, Tor also eliminates records of your online activity from the visited websites’ data. Unfortunately, the heavy network usage can slow down loading speed to some extent, which can be a deterrent for some people.</p></div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>How to install Tor Browser for Android?</h3><p>Once you’ve downloaded and installed Tor browser, you need to click ‘Open’ to start the app. To <strong>establish a secure connection</strong>, you will have to tap on ‘Connect’. This will initiate a process called ‘Bootstrapping’, which allows the Tor network to act as an intermediary for connections between the device and the websites. </p><p>When the ‘Bootstrapping’ process is complete, you will see the home screen appear instantly. While some people think that using Tor Browser can be overwhelming, the app comes with a <strong>useful introduction wizard</strong>. It explains everything about using the program and even takes you through the settings and options.</p></div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>How to configure Tor Browser’s security settings?</h3><p>Tor Browser features <strong>multiple layers of security settings</strong>. You just click the ‘three vertical dots’ in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. This will display a menu with options. You need to choose ‘Security Settings’, where you’ll find a ‘Security Level’ slider bar. It lets you choose from <strong>‘Safest’, ‘Safer’, and ‘Standard’</strong>.</p><p>The browser uses the ‘Standard’ setting on default. However, accessing websites in this mode can make your browsing experience vulnerable to disclosure of identity. Moreover, this mode also needs a few bug fixes.</p><p>On the other hand, if you turn the slider bar to a ‘Safer’ or ‘Safest’ setting option, it will protect you from hackers, government organizations, and advertisers. You’ll be able to <strong>browse the internet securely, without anyone knowing your device location or identity</strong>.</p><p>Simply put, while the ‘Standard’ setting works well for the average user, and ensures good privacy protection, the ‘Safer’ and ‘Safest’ setting options are meant to keep you protected from well-funded agencies and attackers.</p><p>With a typewriter-style font, browsing the internet via Tor Browser can be a different experience. However, it gives you complete anonymity and lets you visit restricted websites without any issues. When it comes to a <strong>safe browsing experience</strong>, Tor Browser for Android is the perfect tool.</p></div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>An ideal choice for ensuring online privacy</h3><p>Tor Browser has been designed for people who value online privacy and freedom. The software comes in handy for people working as journalists, activists, and anyone who lives under an authoritarian regime. Currently, <strong>over a million people use</strong> <strong>Tor Browser </strong>and the user base continues to grow.</p></div>",

Unlike Opera, GX focuses more on features built specifically for the benefit of gamers. These include CPU, RAM, and network limiters and gaming app integrations like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitch.en.softonic.com/\">Twitch</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://discord.en.softonic.com/\">Discord</a>.</p><p>Opera GX is for desktop use while Opera GX Mobile is the gaming browser for mobile devices. They share similar features most of the time. For one, the <strong>Flow</strong> feature is available here—allowing you to <strong>sync</strong> your mobile and computer browsers via a QR code for easy media sharing. Another returning tool is the <strong>GX Corner</strong>, which is the one-tap space for access to <strong>gaming news</strong>, deals, and the like.</p><p>What’s special here, though, is its custom navigation using the <strong>Fast Action Button </strong>(FAB). This makes the interface easier for one-handed use and utilizes haptic feedback with device vibrations whenever you interact with the menu. Other cool features include a built-in <strong>ad blocker</strong>, Dark Mode, crypto-mining protection, and browser themes.

      "detail_info_2": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Powerful tool totally for free</h3><p>What is special about Snapseed is that it was the first totally free image editor. Also, compared to professional <strong>software</strong> like <a href=\"https://adobe-photoshop.en.softonic.com/windows\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Photoshop</a>, it does not fall far shorter in features or effective power to manipulate pictures.</p><div id=\"review-app-page-desktop-wrapper\" class=\"sam-slot mv-m sam-slot--in-read-video\" data-meta=\"sam-in-read-video\"><a id=\"review-app-page-desktop__close\" class=\"is-hidden\" href=\"javascript:void(0)\" onclick=\"this.parentNode.style.display = 'none'; return false\"><div class=\"s-icon s-icon-close\"><svg class=\"s-icon__svg\" viewbox=\"0 0 1024 1024\" role=\"img\"><use class=\"s-icon__use\" xlink:href=\"#s-icon-symbol-close\" x=\"0\" y=\"0\"></use></svg></div></a><div class=\"sam-slot__wrapper\"><div id=\"review-app-page-desktop\" class=\"sam-slot__content\"></div></div><script>sam.cmd.push(function() { sam.display('review-app-page-desktop'); });</script></div> <p>There is a reason that this app has a strong following among the photography community. The <strong>tools</strong> used here are efficient and do exactly what you ask of them. Nik Software originally developed the app before being bought by Google.</p> <p>Google supports the app now so the software stays up-to-date. One thing to note as well is the app has an iOS version that is slightly different. The Android version is just as good, and there is a <strong>PC version</strong> of Snapseed available as well.</p> </div>",
      "detailinfo_1": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h2 class=\"editor-review__headline\">Free photo editing for Android devices</h2><p>Snapseed is a free, Google-owned <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/downloads/photo-editor\" target=\"_blank\">photography editing</a> software. This app brings the power of a computer editor to your phone with simple-to-use preset <strong>filters</strong>. Beyond that, for professional or aspiring photographers, there are many tools to edit images in ways that otherwise only exist in expensive photo editing software.</p></div>",
      "detailinfo_3": "<div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>How to use Snapseed</h3> <p>Once you have downloaded and installed the <strong>Snapseed APK</strong>, it’s easy to get started. The opening screen will ask you to select a picture. For the first time, it will ask to be able to access your pictures. Otherwise, you can opt for the tutorial, which is at the top of the screen.</p> <p>Once you have selected the picture, it will open up to a screen with options at the bottom: looks, tools, and export. The first consists of the preset <strong>editing themes</strong>. These will automatically change your pictures, much like the <a href=\"https://instagram.en.softonic.com/android\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> filters.</p> <p>The tools section has all the things like <strong>crop</strong>, glamour glow, Noir, and more. These settings help you get exactly what you want from your images. Brushing up your pictures becomes easier by using this. One problem is that there is an overwhelming number of options crammed into one tab.</p> <p>Finally, remember to export/save your file. You can either save it to your phone, export it as a <strong>JPG</strong>, export it to a particular folder, or share it directly to <a href=\"https://en.softonic.com/downloads/social-media\" target=\"_blank\">social media</a> whether to your story or feed. However, one problem is that Snapseed does not automatically save your picture.</p> </div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Is Snapseed good?</h3> <p>The quality of what Snapseed does is the next feature. It was designed with mobile phones in mind, so it is easy to use. For example, when changing tones, you can easily control it by sliding right and left to increase or decrease.</p> <p>These features aren't always intuitive; however, tutorials help clear up any confusion you might have as a user. You'll get a better handle on them and be able to apply the knowledge to your edits. The quality of the pictures when they come out is also crisp and clean. It is also able to edit <strong>RAW photos</strong>.</p> <p>One of the best things about Snapseed is that through the <strong>Stacks</strong>, you can have much greater utility. Not only does it allow you to revert what you have done with an edit to an earlier version, but, it also allows one to save the format as a look so that in the future the same settings can be used.</p> </div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Alternatives</h3> <p>The leading competitor in free apps against Snapseed is <strong>VSCO</strong>. What is good about the competition is that it has an emphasis on taking pictures allowing you to place settings in advance for taking photos. Beyond not having as strong a feature set in photo editing, VSCO has many things locked away behind the subscription screen.</p> <p>Adobe’s <strong><a href=\"https://adobe-photoshop-lightroom.en.softonic.com/android\" target=\"_blank\">Lightroom</a></strong> mobile app is technically free and more powerful than Snapseed. Unfortunately, there are many things locked behind a subscription payment. Also, it is not as easy to use as Snapseed. If you are pro, Lightroom would be a better choice, but it is too much otherwise.</p> <p>The last competitor is <strong>Photoshop</strong>. The utility of this program goes far beyond merely touching up photos. On the other hand, Snapseed efficiently condenses down all the editing tools while remaining free. If you want a lot of things in one place, Photoshop might be a good purchase.</p></div><div class=\"detailinfo\"><h3>Excellent picture editing for your phone</h3><p>The Snapseed <strong>mobile app</strong> has done an excellent job of being good enough to be extremely useful while not too good not to be free. Even for professional photographers, it is enough while still being easy to use by the learner. Overall it has a good place.</p> <p>The most recent update made the user interface simplified which made finding everything much smoother. They introduced the <strong>perspectives tool</strong> which allows you to shift where the focus of the photo is. Finally, 11 new looks were added to the already extensive collection.</p></div>",

While in comparison to other MOBAs this cast is limited, it allows Vainglory to create more combos and more meaningful interactions between characters. Unfortunately, the characters you can play as for free continually rotates - meaning if you want to guarantee your favorite is available you will have to pay real money to unlock them.</p><p><strong>Games can last a maximum of 20 minutes</strong>, though usually one team will secure victory long before this time cap is reached. Because of this, Vainglory is designed to reward teams that are able to rapidly coordinate – play well with your teammates and you will easily annihilate your opponents.
